## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Java backend developer with hands-on experience building REST APIs, CRUD systems, and structured backend applications using good software engineering practices.

I work mainly with Java and Spring Boot, applying concepts such as clean code, object-oriented programming, and design patterns. I also have experience with relational databases and SQL, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge in cloud computing and backend scalability.

I'm looking for opportunities as a **Junior or Trainee Software Developer**, where I can contribute to real-world systems while continuously improving my technical skills.
